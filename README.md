10 DoF sensor fusion with AHRS

 Demonstrate basic functionality of the 10 DoF sensor GY-80 including parameterizing the register addresses, 
 initializing the sensor, getting properly scaled accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, pressure and temperature
 data out. Added display functions to allow display to on-breadboard monitor. Addition of 9 DoF sensor fusion using 
 open-source Madgwick and Mahoney quaternion filter algorithms. Runs on a 3.3 V 8 Mhz Pro Mini and the Teensy 3.1.
